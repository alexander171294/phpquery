1º add autoload to models. (make easy load models)
* now isn't necessary write _::declare_model(), is autodeclared by spl_autoload_class (PHP CORE)

2º improve load_requires function. (improve speed)
* now, isn't load always the components, now loads by demand

5º split examples.
* now, the examples are commented and splitted

10º replace attach_header for define_autocall
* now, attach_header not use a stack for load, is changed for _::define_autocall()
[!] for backward compatibility to older versions of PHPQuery, attach_header work, but is an alias of _::define_autocall() (you don't have problem with compatibility)
[!] we recommend you change attach header for define_autocall if it can. Why? we delete in the future this function for reduce resource cost.

[!!!] WE RECOMMEND YOU CHANGE ALL DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS IF IT CAN, WE DELETE IN THE FUTURE ALL DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS FOR REDUCE RESOURCE COST!
